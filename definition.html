<h3>Definition:</h3>
A programming language is a formal language which contains a set of instructions producing different types of output.
 The programming languages are used to apply algorithms in computer programming. Most programming languages consist of the computer instructions.
 There are programmable machines that use a series of unique instructions instead of programming languages generally.
 The early ones preceded the invention of the digital machine, the first being possibly the automatic flute player mentioned by the Musa brothers in Baghdad in the 9th century,
 The programs were used to control machine behaviors such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.
 The programs for these devices (such as scrolls from a player piano) did not generate different actions in response to various inputs or conditions.
 Thousands of different programming languages were created, and more are created annually.
 Many programming languages are written in an imperative style (i.e. as a series of operations to be performed) 
 while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. you decide the desired outcome, not how to achieve it).
 The programming language definition is generally divided into two components of the syntax (form) and the semantic (meaning).
 Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, an ISO standard specifies the programming language for C) 
 whereas other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is considered a reference language. Some languages have the two,
 Popular with the basic language specified by the Standard and extensions derived from the dominant implementation.

<h1>C++ language</h1>
The language of C++ has an object-oriented structure used in large projects. 
Programmers can collaborate on each part of the program with one program in different parts, 
or even with one individual work. The object oriented framework also enables multiple reuse of code. 
This language is an effective language. But, many programmers disagree with that
<h2>C language</h2> 
The C language is a simple programming language and is a very common language,
 particularly used in game programming, since C language requires additional C++ packaging, 
 every programmer uses this language because it makes programs faster. However, 
 the importance of this language gives C++ the reusability to get the small performance improvement with C language.
<h3>Pascal language</h3>
Pascal language is mostly a language of teaching and this language is used by few industries to compose the programmes.
 In C language this language tends to use keywords rather than symbols and braces.
 So beginners understand this language very easily than a programming language such as C, C++. Borland is a software compiler
 company that uses Delphi programming language for strength of industry.Delphi is an object-oriented Pascal language, and currently only use it by Borland compilers.
<h4>Java language</h4>
The Java language is a language of multiple platforms which is especially useful in networking. Of course, 
with Java applets mostly this language is used on the web. However, in structure and syntax, this language is used to design cross-platform programs,
 as it is similar to C++. For programmers with C++,Java language is very easy to learn, and it offers some of the benefits of object-oriented programming.
 Including reusability and the writing of effective code in Java can be difficult. But the speed of the Java language has increased nowadays, 
 and version 1.5 offers some nice features for fast programmaking.
<h5>PHP language</h5>
The PHP language is used to construct web sites, and is often used as scripting language as well.
 This language is designed to develop a fast website, and therefore includes features that make it easy to generate HTTP headers and link to databases. 
 It includes a set of components as a scripting language that allows the programmer to easily get up to speed. However, It has features which are more advanced object oriented.
